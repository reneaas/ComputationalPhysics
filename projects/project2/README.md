# Project 2: Working title



## Codes
To run the codes of the project, I advise to clone the repository pertaining to this project and run the codes in the following way:

### main.py
This is the main code of the project. It essentially automates everything, all we need to do is write:

'''
python3 main.py Number_of_gridpoints Max_number_of_iterations problemtype
'''

You can choose between the solution for two problem types:
1. For the Buckling Beam problem, then problemtype = bb
2. For the quantum mechanics problem, the problemtype = qm

### main.cpp
Contains the main program to solve the eigenvalue problems.

### functions.cpp and functions.h
Contains all the necessary functions for main.cpp to work. It's essentially a package deal.
