# FYS3150 - Computational Physics

This repository contains all my work in the course [FYS3150 - Computational Physics](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/)
at UiO.

## Projects
All my coursework is found under [projects](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/).

### Project 1: 1D-Possions equation
In [project 1](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/project1), the 1-dimensional Poisson equation is solved. The differential equation first recast into a linear tridiagonal matrix equation where the particular matrix we deal with
is known as a Toeplitz matrix. It's solved through three different algorithms: a generalized and a specialized algorithm, and one that
combines the generalized one with LU-decomposition.

Here are the [codes](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/project1/codes) and the
[report](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/project1/report/project1.pdf)

### Project 2: Buckling Beam and Schrödinger's equation
In [project 2](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/project2) the Buckling Beam problem and
Schrödingers equation is solved by conversion of the second order DEs to eigenvalue equations. This project is currently
being solved, so an update on the project will soon come.
Here are the [codes](https://github.com/reneaas/ComputationalPhysics/tree/master/projects/project2/codes) and the
