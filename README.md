# FYS3150 - Computational Physics

This repo contains my work in the course FYS3150 at the University of Oslo, UiO.

# Projects
In the directory "projects" you can find the project files. Inside each project directory
you will find a directory that correspond to codes - named "codes" - written to solve the problem and
a directory dedicated to the report, named "report".
